# ETH Cheat Sheets

This is a collection of cheat sheets I created and extended during my studies at ETHZ. To take a look at the individual sheets, or their source files, just click the emojis. 
For convenience I also linked the lectures so you can look of the content covered in the semester I took the course.

Most of the material found in these notes is either from the primary source (Lecture, books, etc.) or stuff I have found on the internet by a quick google search. 
In any cases where this is not the case, I added the source explicitly in the `Source` column.

None of the materials above, are necessarily complete or correct. Sometimes I might have made a mistake when copying form the source or just not fully understood something. 
So your mileage may vary :wink:
